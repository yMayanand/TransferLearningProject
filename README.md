# TransferLearningProject
This project Demonstrates the use of transfer learning when dataset is small and limited by compute resources.
Here we first train our network with all the weight frozen except the last layer weight that is our classifier till network converges and the we unfreeze all the weights and train our network again at lower learning rate.
